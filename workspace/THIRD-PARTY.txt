# Third-party code and runtime parser guards

See [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md) and [vendor/PROVENANCE.json](vendor/PROVENANCE.json)
for exact upstream sources, licenses and hashes. `vendor/LICENSE` is an unchanged
alias of pdf-lib's MIT `LICENSE.pdf-lib`. Supplementary source notices include
`vendor/LICENSE.pako.zlib`, the verbatim copyright/license header extracted
from pako 1.0.11 `package/lib/zlib/deflate.js`. `PROVENANCE.json` records both
source and notice hashes. This is not proof of every embedded pako version;
upstream's lock also lists 1.0.10. The UMD omits that readable zlib header, so
ship the supplementary notice with the other vendor licenses.

Original Filecraft work in the 0.9 development line uses Apache-2.0; no upstream
code is relicensed. `workbench/worker-bundle.js` is mixed-origin generated code.
Earlier release licenses remain unchanged; see `../docs/LICENSING.md`.
The minified UMD itself is byte-for-byte upstream; runtime guards live in document.js.

Upstream reports [#1777](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib/issues/1777)
(DecodeStream buffer growth) and [#1776](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib/issues/1776)
(XRef stream widths) motivated explicit allocation/parser gates. These are issue
reports, not a claim of a CVE or JavaScript memory corruption.

Before any untrusted parsing, document.js locates the internal shared DecodeStream
prototype using a tiny constant Flate stream through the exported decode function.
DecodeStream is **not** exported by this pin. ensureBuffer is wrapped on its actual
prototype; the wrapper validates numeric requests and rounded capacities **before**
the original allocator executes. Per-decoder capacity is capped at 32 MiB and
cumulative capacity growth across an API job at 64 MiB. A promise queue serializes
jobs sharing this vendor instance and resets accounting after success or failure.
Loading document.js therefore also adds the per-stream guard to direct uses of
this PDFLib instance; only PreparePDF API jobs get cumulative accounting.

The exported PDFXRefStreamParser.forStream factory is wrapped **before construction**
(and thus before XRef decoding) to require exactly three W widths, integer 0–4
bytes each, not all zero, Size at most 100,000, and bounded paired Index ranges.
This intentionally rejects valid PDFs requiring wider fields; it avoids the
upstream 32-bit width loop behavior rather than pretending to support it safely.

Regression tests exercise real zlib-compressed ObjStm bombs, cumulative expansion,
invalid allocation requests, XRef widths and huge counts. These gates do not bound
all allocations/CPU inside every PDF syntax path or content stream decoder. V8
worker quotas and termination remain required; OS process memory limits are needed
for a hard total-memory boundary. No broad sanitization/security guarantee follows.
